## Run project in  your envirnment

## Development server

Download or clone repository and Run `npm install`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.



## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


## Tasks

1. Implement the Front End component using Front End Framework of your choice. The FE
must have 3 parts,

a. Page / Section that captures details as per Domain Model above (Use your
imagination to design the page)
b. Page / Section where Policy / Customer / Risk Details can be view
c. Page / Section that lists all customers (No need to implement paging capability,
keep the list short)
.
2. Simulate your own services / model where youâ€™ll get / store dummy data from or to.
.

3. Which development approach (e.g., Waterfall) would you use? Why? (Keep your to 4 lines max)

I prefer an Agile approach because it has a iterative approach to development that helps teams deliver value faster with less issues. Instead of a waterfall method which goes through phases, an agile approach delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously (in sprints) so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.


4. What assumptions / design decisions did you make, and what was the rationale.(No penalty for not making any assumptions) 

** Looking at the details of the project and the required tasks. I already had the frameworks in mind which will allow me to complete the task at hand. Angular being the framework of choice to build the application and handle all of my logic and bulma to handle my layout and my device responsiveness.


5. General Question, There are different Payment Gateways such as Paypal, STRIPE, etc. Why would you choose STRIPE over Paypal, or the way other way round? 

I honestly didn't know about Stripe until now, Paypal has always been the dominant one and most talked about over it's competitors but after doing some research I would say that it depends on the perspective and needs of a business. From a business point of view to save cost on transactional fees, Stripe would be the prefereed choice, From a developers perspective, I would say Stripe aswell eventhough the setup can get complicated, the UX and API setup, and features is much better than payPal at the moment (Stripe 2 - 0 Paypal). I would choose Paypal


6. A person and a bird are crossing the bridge, who will get to the other end first? Explain Why.
I would say a person. I think a person has an advantage over a bird in terms of taking off. A bird would need more time to take off compare to a human provided that it doesn't have strong hind legs and a small wing span.
